# Job Listing Project

The app provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing job listings, demonstrating the use of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a Vue.js application. JSON Server is utilized to mimic a REST API for efficient data handling during development.

## Key Features

1. Create New Job Listings  
   Users can add job listings by filling out a form with relevant details, which are then stored in the JSON Server.

2. Update Job Listings  
   Existing job listings can be edited, allowing users to update information dynamically.

3. Delete Job Listings  
   Users can remove job listings from the app, ensuring the storage stays clean and up-to-date.
